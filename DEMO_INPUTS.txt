Discipline: Tech
Stance: Neutral
Snippet:
NREL summarizes solar technologies and the grid integration challenges of high solar adoption.
Claim text:
Grid integration and storage remain key bottlenecks for scaling solar.
Quote:
This source notes integration and storage challenges for high solar penetration.

Contradiction
Type: methodology
Explanation:
Lower costs help adoption, but system integration constraints still slow scale-up.
