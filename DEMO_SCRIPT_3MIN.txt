Culture Compass — 3‑Minute Demo Script

0:00–0:10  Hook / Problem
“Teams are drowning in links and talking past each other. We built Culture Compass to make research collaborative, factual, and fast — with receipts.”

0:10–0:25  Start + Tech Setup
“I’m signing in with a quick demo profile. This app is built on Serverpod: Dart backend, Postgres DB, and real‑time streaming.”

0:25–0:45  Create Room (Rooms + Auth)
“I create a room: ‘Solar Energy: Costs vs Grid Constraints.’ Serverpod creates the Room record, stores it in Postgres, and generates an invite code.”

0:45–1:05  Add Source (Sources + Metadata)
“I add a source URL. The backend fetches metadata and stores it in the Sources table. Everyone in the room sees it instantly via Serverpod streaming.”

1:05–1:25  Create Claim (Claims + Receipts)
“I highlight a quote and create a claim. This is stored as a Claim with a receipt, so we can trace every statement back to evidence.”

1:25–1:45  Challenge Claim (Crossref + arXiv)
“Now I challenge the claim. We query Crossref and arXiv to surface counter‑sources, and I can add any of them as new sources with one tap.”

1:45–2:05  Contradictions (Mapping Disagreements)
“I link two claims as a contradiction — time period, geography, methodology, values. That relationship is stored and visible so teams stop arguing and start clarifying.”

2:05–2:30  Brief Generation (LLM + Citations)
“I click Generate Brief. The backend calls Groq to synthesize the brief with citations, then stores it in the Briefs table.”

2:30–2:45  Publish (Relic Web Server)
“I hit Publish. Serverpod’s web server serves a public report at a stable URL, including the brief, sources, claims, and contradictions.”

2:45–3:00  Close / Impact
“Culture Compass turns messy research into shared, factual understanding — real‑time, collaborative, and verifiable. Built with Serverpod’s streaming, database, auth patterns, and web server — and ready for the real world.”
